        <p>You look at the pile of tablets on your desk. You were planning to have another lazy day when you decided to rifle through the stack of homework that you have been procrastinating. Practice worksheets, test prep, quiz prep. Remembering dates, facts and figures. It all bores you and you come to the conclusion that you will have your day of relaxation after all.</p>
        <p>Howeverâ€¦</p>
        <p>You look at one last tablet.</p>
